Project Title: NutriLens – AI-Based Nutrition Information and Awareness Platform
Project Overview:
NutriLens is an innovative web-based application designed to provide real-time, AI-driven nutritional analysis of food items. Developed with a focus on health awareness and informed food consumption, NutriLens serves as an interactive platform for users to explore, understand, and make smarter dietary choices. The project combines web development with artificial intelligence to offer accurate, user-friendly nutritional guidance and educational support.

Key Features:
Smart Search Functionality:
Allows users to search a wide range of food items and receive instant feedback on nutritional content, including calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), vitamins, and minerals.

 AI Chatbot Assistant:
An integrated conversational agent assists users with questions related to dietary needs, food comparisons, label understanding, and healthy food alternatives. It simulates an intelligent nutrition consultant available 24/7.

 Educational Resources:
Includes simplified guides and visuals to help users interpret nutrition labels, understand daily recommended values, and learn the health impacts of various ingredients and additives.

 Responsive Design:
The website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly, ensuring seamless access across devices including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

 Health & Wellness Focus:
Designed for users of all ages, from fitness enthusiasts and patients managing diet-sensitive conditions to parents planning nutritious meals for their families.

Design Tools: Custom color palette for visual appeal and accessibility

AI Integration: Lightweight AI chatbot with a pre-trained model for nutrition-related queries

Planned Enhancements: Integration with barcode scanning (using phone camera), user login for diet tracking, personalized recommendations based on health goals (e.g., weight loss, diabetes management)

Objectives:
Promote nutritional awareness among the general public.

Provide accessible dietary guidance using AI.

Encourage healthy eating habits through informed choices.

Bridge the gap between technical information on food labels and consumer understanding.

Potential Impact:
